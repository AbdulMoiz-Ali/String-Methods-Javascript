      <h1>-: Changing case :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        You ask the user to enter her city. Then you check her city against a
        list of the 5 cleanest <br />
        cities. <br />
        If the user enters "Cheyenne" or any of the other cleanest cities, your
        code displays an <br />
        alert telling her that it's one of the cleanest cities. <br />
        But what if she enters "cheyenne" instead of "Cheyenne"—as some users
        inevitably will? <br />
        When that happens, there will be no match. JavaScript is literal-minded.
        <br />
        A human knows that in this context "cheyenne" means "Cheyenne." But
        JavaScript doesn't. <br />
        We need some way to get JavaScript to recognize the uncapitalized
        version as a match. <br />
        One way would be to expand the cleanestCities array to include the
        uncapitalized <br />
        versions of all the city names: <br />
        var cleanestCities = ["Cheyenne", "cheyenne", "Santa Fe", "santa fe",
        "Tucson", tucson", "Gr eat Falls",<br />
        "great falls", "Honolulu", "honolulu"]; <br />
        This works up to a point, but it's a lot of extra coding. Plus, if the
        user enters "santa Fe ,"<br />
        "Santa fe," or "sAnta Fe," we're back to the original problem. To cover
        all these possibilit es<br />
        and others, it would take a mile of code. <br />
        The solution is to code the array elements in lower-case, and convert
        the user's input, <br />
        whatever it is, to lower-case, so we always have apples to compare with
        apples. <br />
        1 var cityToCheck = prompt("Enter your city"); <br />
        2 cityToCheck = cityToCheck.toLowerCase(); <br />
        3 var cleanestCities = ["cheyenne", "santa fe", "tucson", "great falls",
        "honolulu"]; <br />
        4 for (var i = 0; i <= 4; i++) { <br />
        5 if (cityToCheck === cleanestCities[i]) { <br />
        6 alert("It's one of the cleanest cities"); <br />
        7 } <br />
        8 } <br />
        Line 2 is what's new here: <br />
        2 cityToCheck = cityToCheck.toLowerCase(); <br />
        The converted string is assigned to a variable. In this case, it's the
        same variable whose <br />
        string is being converted, cityToCheck. Note that the keyword
        toLowerCase must be in <br />
        camelCase. <br />
        Note too that the toLowerCase method converts all the characters of the
        string to lowercase, not just the initial letters. For example,
        "ChEyEnNe" becomes "cheyenne." <br />
        You could go the other way and convert everything to upper-case, then
        test against <br />
        "CHEYENNE," "SANTA FE, " etc. Most coders prefer the lower-case method.
        To convert the <br />
        string to upper-case, you'd write: <br />
        2 cityToCheck = cityToCheck.toUpperCase(); <br />
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="moiz">
      <h1>-: Strings: Measuring length and extracting parts :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        You've asked the user to give you the name of a city. You want to
        convert the name she's <br />
        given you to a name with an initial cap. Whether she's input "boston,"
        "BOSTON", or <br />
        "bosTon," you want to normalize the input to "Boston." The toLowerCase
        and toUpperCase <br />
        methods you learned in the last chapter won't get the job done on their
        own, because they make <br />
        the same wholesale change to every character in the string. But if you
        break the string up into <br />
        two segments, you can use these methods to get the string into the shape
        you want. (For now, <br />
        I'll ignore the possibility that the city name might be made up of two
        or more words, like New <br />
        Orleans or Sault Ste. Marie.) <br />
        To copy a section of a string, you use the slice method. Suppose the
        user has entered a <br />
        string, and the string has been assigned to the variable cityToCheck.
        The following code <br />
        copies the first character of the string and assigns it to the variable
        firstChar. The original <br />
        value of cityToCheck doesn't change. If cityToCheck is "Boston",
        firstChar is "B". <br />
        var firstChar = cityToCheck.slice(0, 1); <br />
        Things to be aware of: <br />
        A string is indexed like an array. Only, instead of each index number
        referring to an <br />
        element, it refers to a character. <br />
        Like array indexing, string indexing begins with 0. <br />
        In the slice method, the first number inside the parentheses is the
        index of the first <br />
        character in the slice. The second number is not, however, the last
        character in the slice. <br />
        It's the first character after the slice. If you subtract the first
        index from the second index, <br />
        you'll always get the length of the slice. <br />
        Here's another example. <br />
        var someChars = cityToCheck.slice(2, 5); <br />
        Again let's say that the string is "Boston". The slice begins with the
        index-2 (the third) <br />
        character, "s". It ends with the character before the index-5 character,
        "n". someChars is "sto". <br />
        If you omit the second number inside the parentheses, JavaScript
        includes all the <br />
        characters to the end of the string. <br />
        var someChars = cityToCheck.slice(2); <br />
        The slice begins with the index-2 (the third) character, "s". Since no
        cutoff at the end is <br />
        specified, the slice ends with the last character of the string.
        someChars is "ston". <br />
        Now we have a way to capitalize the first character of a string and
        insure that the <br />
        remaining letters are lower-case. <br />
        1 var firstChar = cityToCheck.slice(0, 1); <br />
        2 var otherChars = cityToCheck.slice(1); <br />
        3 firstChar = firstChar.toUpperCase(); <br />
        4 otherChars = otherChars.toLowerCase(); <br />
        5 var cappedCity = firstChar + otherChars; <br />
        Here's what happens in the code above, line-by-line: <br />
        1. Copies the first character of the string and assigns it to the
        variable firstChar. <br />
        2. Copies all the characters from the second one to the end and assigns
        them to the variable <br />
        otherChars. <br />
        3. Caps the first character. <br />
        4. Lower-cases the other characters. <br />
        5. Concatenates both parts to re-form the whole string. <br />
        Sometimes it's useful to know how many characters are in a string. For
        example, suppose <br />
        you want to slice the first three characters from any string than
        exceeds three characters in <br />
        length, for example, slicing "Nov" from "November". To find the number
        of characters in a <br />
        string, you use the same language you've already learned to find the
        number of elements in an <br />
        array. <br />
        1 var month = prompt("Enter a month"); <br />
        2 var charsInMonth = month.length; <br />
        3 if (charsInMonth > 3) { <br />
        4 monthAbbrev = month.slice(0, 3); <br />
        5 } <br />
        Line 2 counts the characters in the string and assigns the number to the
        variable <br />
        charsInMonth. <br />
        Being able to measure the number of characters in a string can come in
        handy. For <br />
        example, suppose you want to loop through a string, checking to see if
        it has any double spaces <br />
        in it. You can use the character count as the loop limiter. Here's some
        code that checks for <br />
        double spaces in a string and displays an alert if they're found. <br />
        1 var str = prompt("Enter some text"); <br />
        2 var numChars = str.length; <br />
        3 for (var i = 0; i < numChars; i++) { <br />
        4 if (str.slice(i, i + 2) === " ") { <br />
        5 alert("No double spaces!"); <br />
        6 break; <br />
        7 } <br />
        8 } <br />
        Line 2 counts the number of characters in the string and assigns the
        number to the variable <br />
        numChars. In line 3, this number is used as the loop limiter. The loop
        continues to run only as <br />
        long as the counter, i, is less than the number of characters in the
        string. (Remember, the length <br />
        is 1-based, and the counter is 0-based, so the loop has to stop 1 short
        of the length number.) <br />
        Line 4 moves through the string character-by-character, examining each
        2-character segment, <br />
        looking for double spaces. <br />

      <h1>-: Strings: Finding segments :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        The New Yorker magazine doesn't allow the phrase "World War II. " They
        say it should <br />
        be "the Second World War." So let's search the following sentence for
        the banned characters <br />
        and replace them with the phrase that the New Yorker prefers. <br />
        It is startling to think that, even in the darkest depths of World War
        II, J. R. R. Tolkien was <br />
        writing the trilogy, which contains, with the weird applicability
        available only to poetry and <br />
        myth, the essential notion that the good gray wizard can understand the
        evil magi precisely <br />
        because he is just enough like them to grasp their minds and motives in
        ways that they cannot <br />
        grasp his. <br />
        You already know a way to find the banned segment and replace it.
        Suppose the <br />
        paragraph above has been assigned to the variable text. <br />
        1 for (var i = 0; i < text.length; i++) { <br />
        2 if (text.slice(i, i + 12) === "World War II") { <br />
        3 text = text.slice(0, i) + "the Second World War" + text.slice(i + 12);
        <br />
        4 } <br />
        5 } <br />
        The code loops through the string looking for "World War II." Line 2
        progresses through <br />
        the string character-by-character, examining each 12-character sequence.
        If it finds "World <br />
        War II," line 3 concatenates three segments: all the characters
        preceding "World War II," the <br />
        substitute phrase "the Second World War," and then all the characters
        following "World War <br />
        II." <br />
        But JavaScript has a more efficient way to accomplish this, using the
        indexOf method. <br />
        var firstChar = text.indexOf("World War II"); <br />
        If the segment exists, the method finds the index of the first character
        of the segment and <br />
        assigns it to the variable firstChar. If the segment doesn't exist, the
        method assigns -1 to the<br />
        variable, so you know it's not there. <br />
        Now we can replace the banned phrase with the preferred phrase with less
        coding. <br />
        1 var firstChar = text.indexOf("World War II"); <br />
        2 if (firstChar !== -1) { <br />
        3 text = text.slice(0, firstChar) + "the Second World War" +
        text.slice(firstChar + 12); <br />
        4 { <br />
        Line 1 checks for the phrase, assigning the index of the first character
        of the phrase to the <br />
        variable firstChar—if the phrase is found. If it isn't found, -1 is
        assigned to the variable. If <br />
        the variable doesn't have the value -1 (line 2)—if the phrase has been
        found—the <br />
        concatenation in line 3 replaces the offending phrase with the correct
        pharse. <br />
        The indexOf method finds only the first instance of the segment you're
        looking for. In the <br />
        example above, you could overcome this limitation by looping. You'd
        change the first instanc <br />
        of "World War II" to "the Second World War," then in the next loop
        iteration, find the next <br />
        surviving instance and change that, and so on. <br />
        To find the last instance of a segment in a string, use lastIndexOf. The
        following code <br />
        finds the index of the first character of the last instance of the
        segment, the second "be". The <br />
        variable segIndex winds up with a value of 16, the index of "b" in the
        second "be". <br />
        1 var text = "To be or not to be."; <br />
        2 var segIndex = text.lastIndexOf("be"); <br />

        The user has entered his first name. The string has been assigned to the
        variable <br />
        firstName. You want to extract the first character. You already know one
        way to do it. <br />
        var firstChar = firstName.slice(0, 1); <br />
        Here's an alternate way to do it that's more direct. <br />
        var firstChar = firstName.charAt(0) <br />
        The code above finds a single character at index-0 (the beginning) of
        the string <br />
        represented by the variable firstName and assigns it to the variable
        firstChar. <br />
        The following code finds the last character in the string. <br />
        var lastChar = name.charAt(name.length - 1); <br />
        The following code cycles through a string looking for an exclamation
        point. If the <br />
        character is found, an alert displays. <br />
        1 for (var i = 0; i < text.length; i++) { <br />
        2 if (text.charAt(i) === "!") { <br />
        3 alert("Exclamation point found!"); <br />
        4 break; <br />
        5 } <br />
        6 } <br />
        Note: The indexOf method can only identify the character at a particular
        location. It can't <br />
        change the character at a location. <br />

      <h1>-: Strings: Replacing characters :-</h1>
      <p class="ali">
        In previous chapters you learned two different ways to replace "World
        War II" with "the <br />
        Second World War" in a string. First, there was the loop-and-slice
        approach. <br />
        1 for (var i = 0; i < text.length; i++) { <br />
        2 if (text.slice(i, i + 12) === "World War II") { <br />
        3 text = text.slice(0, 1) + "the Second World War" + text.slice(i + 12);
        <br />
        4 } <br />
        5 } <br />
        You improved on that rather crude approach when you learned the indexOf
        method. <br />
        1 var firstChar = text.indexOf("World War II"); <br />
        2 if (firstChar !== -1) { <br />
        3 text = text.slice(0, firstChar) + "the Second World War" +
        text.slice(firstChar + 12) <br />; 4 } <br />
        But JavaScript provides a more straightforward way still, the replace
        method. <br />
        var newText = text.replace("World War II", "the Second World War");
        <br />
        The first string inside the parentheses is the segment to be replaced.
        The second string is <br />
        the segment to be inserted. In the above code, the segment "World War
        II" is replaced by the <br />
        segment "the Second World War" in the string represented by the variable
        text, and the <br />
        revised string is assigned to the new variable newText. <br />
        If you assign the revised string to a new variable, as in the example
        above, the original <br />
        string is preserved. If you want the original string to be replaced by
        the revised string, assign<br />
        the revised string to the original variable. <br />
        text = text.replace("World War II", "the Second World War"); <br />
        In the examples above, only the first instance of a string is replaced.
        If you want to <br />
        replace all instances, you must let JavaScript know that you want a
        global replace. <br />
        var newText = text.replace(/World War II/g, "the Second World War");
        <br />
        In a global replace, you enclose the segment to be replaced by slashes
        instead of <br />
        quotation marks, and follow the closing slash with "g" for "global." The
        segment to be inserted<br />
        is enclosed by quotation marks, as in a one-time replace. <br />
